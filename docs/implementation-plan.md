# Alpha Phone — implementation plan

October 1 architecture change: the user has selected an **Android-resident agent instead of Nitro/TEE hosting**. The [on-device agent plan](on-device-agent-plan.md) supersedes cloud-only and enclave-primary requirements below. The current implementation runs orchestration locally with an explicitly configured hosted Cerebras model; this is not offline LLM operation. Historical evidence is retained. A powered-off phone cannot execute local schedules; optional remote execution has separate acceptance requirements.

September 30 scope update: the [MVP report](mvp-scope-and-gap-report.md) and [completion plan](mvp-completion-plan.md) govern current priority. Earlier cloud-only/local-model statements do not waive the supplied DoD's on-device STT/TTS requirement; offline LLM and external-versus-TEE inference remain explicitly reconciled there.

This plan starts from the setup foundation in this repository. See [verification gates](verification.md) for required evidence; planned acceptance criteria below are not passing results.

Per-flow requirements and device acceptance are tracked in
[flow-implementation-plan.md](flow-implementation-plan.md),
[mvp-current-status.md](mvp-current-status.md), and
[verification.md](verification.md). The target is a Pixel 10 or similar
phone; tablet geometry is not the current acceptance target.

## Dependency order

`foundation → E1/E2 → AP1 pairing → AP2 conversation → AP3 lifecycle/voice → AP4 daily overview → AP5 native capabilities → AP6 connectors/workflows → AP7 OS qualification → AP8 pilot`

OS hardware/source discovery starts alongside E1 and can block AP7 independently. Wallet work is explicitly outside the first vertical slice.

## Product work packages

| Package / owner role | Concrete implementation | Dependency | Tests and completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AP1 — Mobile/runtime | Replace unconnected composer via `apps/app/src/runtime/alpha-client.ts`; reuse E2 auth/pairing; add pairing/recovery screens and Android secure token adapter; implement approved endpoint routing rather than accepting arbitrary URLs | E1, E2; endpoint owner decision | Real account/agent pairing; wrong owner/origin, expired/reused callbacks rejected; restart retains correct agent; no tokens in logcat |
| AP2 — UI | Split current home into `home`, `assistant`, `apps`, `settings`; implement four conversation sizes, retained draft/scroll, focus return, keyboard insets, explicit loading/empty/error states using prototype assets/tokens | AP1; UI routes agreed | Portrait/landscape, large font, keyboard and Back/Home loops; separate alpha screenshots; no raw prototype state used as data |
| AP3 — Runtime/voice | Wire speech and streamed replies; explicit stop/cancel, background reconnect, deduped missed messages and visible offline mode; request microphone only at use | AP1–2, E5 | Kill/reopen, radio toggle, sleep/wake, stream cancel, late callbacks and echo tests; type-only path always works |
| AP4 — App data | Agenda/attention/brief cards with provider provenance, freshness and actionable routing; no data shown until connected; configure which proactive workflows are enabled | AP1, E4; provider choices | Empty/expired/revoked account and stale-cache states; opening card reaches correct source object; audit receipts |
| AP5 — Native/mobile | Keep real installed-app handoff; add phone/messages/contacts/camera/files/maps through existing native plugins, one capability at a time. Build role setup and denied-permission paths; avoid changing the secure lock screen from the WebView | AP2, native role decision | Real calls/SMS test environment, denied permissions, unavailable handlers, returning HOME. Emergency/system routes remain usable |
| AP6 — Integrations | Inbox/calendar and workflow list/run history through Google Workspace/personal-assistant/workflow APIs. Add per-account permissions, activity inspection, revoke and cancellation | AP1, E3–4 | Read/write authorization separation, recipient/account confirmation, idempotent result display and no automatic repeat after ambiguous writes |
| AP7 — OS/release | Choose exact phone SKU/Android release; add missing device locks or qualify existing grizzly inputs; stage signed Alpha launcher via E6; select HOME/default roles through provisioning; configure Chromium signer and OTA compatibility | E6; approved hardware, signing and managed endpoint | Linux clean image build, Cuttlefish boot, real phone flash/hardware matrix, signed update and rollback. Stage the admitted resident runtime and local Whisper/Kokoro assets; qualify physical execution separately |
| AP8 — Product/QA/support | Accessibility/latency/battery soak, privacy review, pilot instrumentation, support escalation and staged rollout/rollback runbook | AP1–7 | Target-user complete-task test; measured reliability and latency budgets; named support owner and rollback drill |
| AP9 — Future decision | Wallet, secure side-key payment, enclave/attestation claims | Separate provider/custody/security decisions | Hardware-backed evidence and transaction-specific approval before any real transfer; never reuse mock success text |

## First production vertical slice

Use one real test owner and agent. Install the standalone APK, pair, send a typed request, receive a true remote result, open an installed app, press HOME on launcher flavor, background while a result arrives, kill/reopen, and recover exactly one result under the same owner. Repeat with wrong account, revoked credentials and no network. Deliver screen recording plus device/agent trace IDs with secrets removed. Only then connect overview cards and additional app views.

## Prototype-to-code coverage

Boot/lock → native launch theme and system lock handoff; home → current home expanded with real data; shade → system capability/notification integration; Phone/Messages/Contacts → native bridges first; Inbox/Calendar → account-scoped APIs; Browser → isolated browser surface; Camera/Photos/Files → Android permissions and content URIs; Maps → navigation provider/handoff; Notes → existing store; Wallet → deferred; Workflows → existing scheduler; Settings → real capability controls. Gesture and hardware-button paths need native verification independently of touch controls.

## Blocking product decisions

Assign a product owner and engineering owner to: hardware choice; managed Alpha routing/endpoint; required default roles; voice provider/privacy; MVP view priority; background notification policy; signed update authority; wallet deferral. Record a decision and evidence link before adding scope. Treat the upstream issue estimates as historical planning context only.

## Shared Eliza platform work

These changes belong in Eliza once and are consumed through reviewed source pins. Each product owns its adapter configuration and UI. Do not make senior-care consent rules the universal default for all agents.

| Work package | Existing code to inspect/reuse | Add or change | Dependencies and exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 — Consumer build contract | `packages/app/app.config.ts`, `capacitor.config.ts`, `scripts/mobile/context.ts`, `scripts/mobile/targets/android.ts` | Export a supported app-host composition/bootstrap entrypoint that accepts a renderer and identity; separate default views from transport/native initialization; make release callbacks, authorities, URL schemes, icons, storage namespace and build output agree on the selected identity | Two clean external consumer builds with no relative monorepo path leaks; both APK modes install together across brands; scan APK for canonical-identity leaks |
| E2 — Agent transport and ownership | `packages/ui/src/android-cloud/android-cloud-auth.ts`, `android-cloud-client.ts`, `packages/app/src/api/auth-pairing-routes.ts`, `packages/ui/src/state/agent-session-recovery.ts` | Extract narrow renderer-safe client interfaces for account sign-in, owner/agent pairing, streaming, reconnect and cancellation. Preserve server-derived ownership; bind credentials to account, agent and origin; expose explicit unavailable/expired/wrong-owner states | E1; real test account pairs on phone, restarts, restores missed messages once; stale response after account switch is discarded; malformed/wrong-origin callback cannot install credentials |
| E3 — Observation/action boundary | `plugins/plugin-browser`, `plugins/plugin-native-browser-surface`, `packages/ui/src/platform/browser-surface.ts`, `packages/os/browser` | Typed versioned observations, stable target identities, sensitive-region exclusions, overlay geometry/insets, stale-target rejection and declared capabilities; isolate third-party origin from Capacitor privileges. Add product policy hooks before every actuator path, including raw keyboard, JS evaluation, submit and accessibility actions | Browser/security capability spike; malicious page cannot approve its own action; layout shift invalidates old target; child WebView has no privileged app bridge |
| E4 — Task policy and durable results | `packages/core/src/services/approval.ts`, `plugins/plugin-workflow`, `plugins/plugin-personal-assistant/src/actions/lib/approval-execution.ts`, `packages/agent/src/services/message-interaction-session-store.ts` | Reuse existing stores and approval service, extend with exact proposal/context binding, cancellation epoch, duplicate event rejection, critical-state journal and unknown-outcome receipt. Disable broad/proactive packs per product where incompatible | E2–E3; process death before/during/after a write; no automatic effect replay; tenant/account/task isolation; receipt persistence failure differs from operation failure |
| E5 — Voice and secrets | `plugins/plugin-native-talkmode`, `packages/ui/src/voice`, `packages/agent/src/services/audio-redaction-service.ts`, `plugins/plugin-native-secure-store`, `packages/app/src/services/steward-credentials.ts` | Explicit mic lifecycle, permission-denied fallback, self-playback rejection, transcription confidence, configurable slow-speaker timeout, secret redaction before remote transport, credential-provider references instead of raw values | Chosen ASR/TTS + product mic policy; interruption/cancel tests with real audio; no passwords/OTP/token values in transcripts, screenshots, model input or logs; voice-off remains off across suspend |
| E6 — OS product and release contract | `packages/os/scripts/distro-android/stage-launcher-overlay.ts` (added by this setup), `build-aosp.ts`, `brand-config.ts`, `android/hardware-targets.json` | Consume verified launcher overlay in product-specific build orchestration, separate cloud-only from full local-agent payload validators, declare browser signer allowlist and default-role provisioning, add release descriptor linking app SHA/cert/version to OS image SHA | E1 plus selected hardware; Linux AOSP build, Cuttlefish boot, then real-device role/hardware/OTA/rollback evidence. Retain stock recovery access; do not remove other HOME apps implicitly |

### Native launcher API consolidation

`DeviceApps` keeps the product's bridge identity and build information. Installed-app discovery and launch-intent resolution delegate to upstream `SystemLauncherApps` in `plugins/plugin-native-system`; the host owns the actual Activity handoff. Package visibility remains scoped to launchable activities, without `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`. The shared helper filters self, disabled and unexported entries, sorts labels and deduplicates packages. Icons, package-change notifications and work-profile behavior remain separate feature work, not claims made by the current enumeration API.

### Shared contract shape

- `RuntimeSession`: owner identity from authentication, agent ID, opaque session ID, connection epoch and capability set. Store tokens only through the platform credential provider.
- `TaskSession`: owner/account/task identity, lifecycle state, active origin, selected object, observation version, pending proposal, checkpoint and external-operation status.
- `ActionProposal`: unique ID, exact operation and target, opaque value references, preconditions, observation version, explanation, expiry and required policy. No generic “yes to everything.”
- `OperationResult`: succeeded, denied, cancelled, retryable-failure, unsupported, or unknown; factual evidence reference; no synthetic success.
- `Observation`: validated origin/page, current targets/bounds/focus/sensitivity, capture timestamp/version and reliability. Redact before the model boundary.
- `Receipt`: operation/task identity, observed provider status, exact-decimal/minor-unit amount if applicable, source/evidence, timestamps and separate storage outcome.

Keep these contracts host-independent in the existing core/shared contracts layer. Native adapters provide capabilities; product policy reduces them. Do not add a second scheduler, identity provider or general-purpose credential vault.
