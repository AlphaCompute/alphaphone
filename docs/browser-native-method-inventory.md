# Native bridge method inventory

Generated from product main/debug Android source on October 2, 2026; instrumentation fixtures are excluded. This is an audit checklist, not a statement that every browser method is implemented.

Total: 18 plugin declarations, 166 method declarations. AlphaBrowser also emits `stateChanged`, `tabOpened`, `tabClosed` and `notice` events.

Imported upstream ports used by the renderer also require parity: ElizaSystem (status/settings/default roles), ElizaCamera (preview/capture/recording/focus/zoom/flash), ElizaContacts (permission/list/create), ElizaLocation (permission/watch/clear), and Capacitor SystemBars (style/insets). Their checkouts remain pinned and unmodified.

See [implementation and acceptance ledger](browser-dev-parity.md) for each capability group and remaining work.

## Browser dispatch audit after the second checkpoint

A registered plugin is not proof that every method exists. Keep the following call paths explicit when finishing parity:

- Calendar: the browser port now implements all listed methods, including operation review/cancel and durable replay. Tests cover cancellation, stale approval and reload replay. Remaining qualification is the actual assistant proposal path, not another direct-port-only test.
- Files and selected documents: the browser port covers local trees, read-only directory import into that tree, revision-bound selection, atomic mutations, text/binary/PDF preview, sandboxed opening, download and forget. `AlphaMailAttachments` now validates exact bytes and reviewed hashes. Persistent OS directory write-through is not claimed.
- Reminder operations: the browser port implements selected targets, bound durable operation receipts and recurrence in saved timezones. The production implementation is `browser/reminder-recurrence.ts`; there is no parallel alternative recurrence algorithm.
- `AlphaBrowser.reviewReading`: implemented through reviewed source text and local speech; opaque frames use selected/pasted excerpts. Navigation ownership, local-only voice selection, cancellation and bookmark recovery now have browser tests. These do not assert arbitrary cross-origin page extraction.
- `AlphaNotifications`: all listed browser methods now have local implementations. App/channel/access settings, shared development app sources, explicit event posting, preview policy, redacted bounded history and revision-bound open/dismiss/clear are covered. Policy/history changes retire queued observations; failed storage commits do not publish. These are local dev events, not access to notifications from other host applications. The durable synthetic device queue now mirrors rediscovery after reload/policy changes, including source-scoped replacement, ongoing/secret events and source cancellation. Session-bound observations reject stale actions after lifecycle transitions; six additional tests cover queue durability, cross-tab consistency and rendered editing. `AlphaHostedResults` now has browser notice publication, pending/consume, polling preference and status methods, backed by the existing DigestInbox after-commit path. Notification toggle, reload recovery, disconnected binding retirement, paused/resumed checks and delayed taps across lock/unlock now pass the rendered connected-browser fixture. Browser transport reuses the verified JS client rather than native credential-slot APIs.
- `AlphaHostedResults`: browser pending/consume/history/poll lifecycle contracts and connected rendered journeys are implemented and tested, as described above. Closed-browser delivery remains outside browser execution evidence.
- `AlphaNoteAudio`: browser `describe`/`migrationStatus`, transcript metadata, owner-checked recoverable deletion/restoration, operation-bound `purge` for Notes Trash expiry and Delete forever, and the 30-day expired-trash backstop are implemented. Native `started`/`ended`/`failed` events accompany the existing voice playback events; cross-tab deletion retires active playback. Tests cover save replay, wrong-owner rejection, failed-write rollback, metadata migration, malformed-row recovery status, expiry and actual playback after reload/Notes Undo. Browser storage remains origin-local rather than Android credential storage.
- `AlphaVoiceCloud` and `DevelopmentAgent`: retained-recording transcript review now supports explicit local SpeechRecognition with manual entry when unavailable. Saved audio is supplied as an audio track; local processing is mandatory, language installation is explicit, and cancellation releases the owner. Headless/Electron builds use manual review to avoid an observed native speech-service crash. Recognition provider tests use a controlled provider and do not establish acoustic accuracy. Paired/cloud transport and development chat still need consumer-by-consumer qualification.
- Camera/photos: existing browser library and editor are separate product-owned implementations rather than a web registration for every upstream method. Qualify capture zoom/brightness/flash, scan/import fallback and video audio/limits/lifecycle against rendered controls.
- `AlphaDevice`/ElizaSystem: simulated roles and settings state exist. Text scaling and brightness now have visible persisted effects, including dynamic text and shade/settings integration; browser permission facts reflect actual grants. Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/airplane and microphone/location shade controls now share persisted Settings state. Sensor policy cancels live/pending capture and location watches; browser Media volume drives owned playback. DND and Ring/Alarm volumes now control local alert tones. Browser Clock has a rendered list and revision-bound snooze/dismiss/delete; one foreground tab owns ringing. Remaining settings-navigation and simulator action coverage is still pending.
- Agent/journal/connection/maps: several paths already dispatch through JavaScript rather than Capacitor. Audit each consumer before adding duplicate web plugins. Exercise the actual local runtime and persisted action journal through approve/cancel/reconnect flows.
- Local Phone/Messages/Contacts/Inbox/Workflow/Wallet views are restored only in the development profile. Every rendered action needs state-transition and reload coverage, including attachments, draft/send receipts and run cancellation. Current navigation checks do not establish functional completeness.

These are the remaining implementation gates, not waived limitations. New equivalents should operate normally without native-only warning banners, while development data and real provider effects remain distinct.


### October 2 integrated browser snapshot

The recorded renderer/runtime/device/media snapshot passed **245 browser tests**
and **82 repository tests**, typecheck and build; no Android build ran in that
campaign. These historical counts do not qualify current main. See the
[browser review](mvp-browser-review.md#qualification-and-evidence) for current
qualification boundaries and unresolved work.
