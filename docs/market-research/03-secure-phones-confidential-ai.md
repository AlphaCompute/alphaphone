# 03 — Secure and sovereign phones, and confidential-compute AI

Research date: 2026-09-30. Workstream #3 of the [manifest](00-manifest.md). This file is market research, not engineering acceptance. Alpha Phone's product facts come from the repository: [`docs/enclave-candidate-validation.md`](../enclave-candidate-validation.md) and the manifest baseline.

**Method notes**

- Every number has a source URL next to it. Figures marked **(est.)** are analyst estimates or modelled values. Figures marked **(unverified)** are widely reported, but no primary source could be retrieved in this session. The session's web-search budget ran out part-way through Part B, and several publisher domains blocked fetches. Verify these figures before using them externally. **Update 2026-10-02:** a verification pass with working web search resolved most of these (marked "(verified 2026-10-02)" or "(could not verify)"); see the Verification log at the end.
- Funding rounds carry the announcement date.
- Where sources disagree, both values are shown and the disagreement is flagged.

## Executive summary

1. **Secure phones are a small, government-anchored, high-price niche.** Buyers pay $1,000–$4,500+ per handset plus server and licence fees. Winners are sold through national accreditation, such as Germany's BSI (Secusmart), France's ANSSI (Thales/Ercom), Finland (Bittium) and the UAE (Katim). Better hardware alone has not won this market. Nearly every standalone "secure phone" startup (Sirin Labs, Blackphone/Silent Circle, Boeing Black) failed or was absorbed. The mass-market default became hardened commodity devices: Samsung Knox and Tactical Edition, and Pixel with NIAP certification.
2. **The US DoD is shifting from government-furnished phones to BYOD plus virtualization.** The Army set a 30 May 2026 deadline to turn in DMUC devices and pointed users to BYOD through Hypori and MAM. Hypori holds an IL5 authorization through 2028. That is a warning for any "second secure phone" pitch to US defense.
3. **Confidential AI is now table stakes for big platforms.** Apple PCC (June 2024), Meta WhatsApp Private Processing (April 2025) and Google Private AI Compute (November 2025) share a pattern: attested TEEs, stateless processing, published measurements or transparency logs, OHTTP or IP-blinding relays, and third-party audits. Startups (Tinfoil, Privatemode, Phala, OPAQUE, Confident Security/OpenPCC) sell that pattern to everyone else.
4. **TEEs do not protect against a physical attacker with the host.** WireTap and Battering RAM (2025, DDR4), TEE.fail (October 2025, DDR5, under $1,000) and DDRop (September 2026, DDR5, about $159) all broke SGX, TDX or SEV-SNP confidentiality and/or attestation. TEE.fail also forged the attestation that NVIDIA GPU confidential computing relies on. A May 2026 software-only paper extracted AMD Milan's root VCEK seed. Intel and AMD answer that physical attacks are out of scope.
5. **For Alpha, the most important point:** today Alpha attests the *orchestrator* in a Nitro Enclave. The *inference*, the step that sees all of the user's prompt context, runs in plaintext at Cerebras, and no attestation covers it. Nitro Enclaves cannot host GPUs. "Attested enclave inference" is therefore not an accurate description of the current system. The accurate one is "attested agent runtime with contractually no-retention third-party inference." A defensible "data never leaves the trust boundary" claim needs one of three things: an attested confidential-GPU inference hop, on-device inference, or redaction before the Cerebras hop. It also needs phone-side attestation verification and public release transparency. See Part C.

## A2. Hardened commodity platforms (the actual volume market)

| Platform | What it is | Certifications / programs | Pricing / scale | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Samsung Knox / Knox Vault** | Knox Vault is a separate tamper-resistant subsystem with its own processor and SRAM. It destroys its keys when it detects laser, voltage or temperature attacks ([AirDroid Knox guide](https://www.airdroid.com/samsung-solution/what-is-samsung-knox/)) | CC, FIPS 140-3, DISA STIG, **NSA CSfC** component list, NATO Restricted ([same](https://www.airdroid.com/samsung-solution/what-is-samsung-knox/); [FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/samsung-knox-nsa/)) | Commodity prices (about $800–$1,300) (est.) | The default "secure Android" for governments worldwide |
| **Samsung Galaxy Tactical Edition** (S23 TE, XCover6 Pro TE) | Commercial device plus a custom ROM for military use: TAK, night-vision mode, tactical radios ([Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/business/solutions/industries/government/tactical-edition/)) | Used by "all branches" of the US military ([Samsung Newsroom](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-tactical-edition-help-military-personnel-make-informed-decisions-achieve-objectives-securely-share-mission-data/)) | Quote-only ([GetGoTAK](https://getgotak.com/products/samsung-s23-tactical-edition)) | As of Sept 2026, Samsung's public page still lists the S23 TE, not an S25 TE |
| **Google Pixel for government** | Titan M2 plus stock Android | **NIAP MDFPP**: Pixel 9/10 families validated on Android 17. Prior validation IDs VID11545 (Android 15) and VID11647 (Android 16) ([Google Pixel help](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/11062200?hl=en)). Pixel added to **DoDIN APL**; Pixel 10 not yet listed there ([Google Cloud blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-sector/google-pixel-phones-achieve-dodin-apl-certification-secure-mission-ready-mobile-technology-for-federal-agencies); [Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-phones-earn-department-of-defense-approval)) | Retail | **Most relevant to Alpha**: Alpha targets Pixel 10. NIAP validation covers *stock* Android. A custom HOME launcher or AOSP image would need its own evaluation |
| **Thales / Ercom Cryptosmart** | Hardened Samsung plus Cryptosmart encryption (calls, SMS, data). Hybrid post-quantum (CRYSTALS-Kyber) pilot ([Thales](https://cds.thalesgroup.com/en/ercom/cryptosmart-mobile); [BusinessWire 2023](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230224005027/en/Thales-pioneers-Post-Quantum-Cryptography-with-a-successful-world-first-pilot-on-phone-calls)) | Only ANSSI-certified "Restricted" solution. Used by the French Ministry of Defence and the Élysée ([Thales](https://cds.thalesgroup.com/en/hot-topics/ministry-defense-and-office-president-republic-france-have-selected-ercom-secure-their)) | Per-seat licence, not public | National champion model |
| **BlackBerry Secusmart / SecuSUITE** | Secure voice and messaging on commodity phones; BSI-approved in Germany | German government anchor. **Government of Canada** renewed and expanded SecuSUITE plus UEM via Shared Services Canada ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/sectors/technology/articles/blackberry-expands-government-canada-secure-141800341.html)) | BlackBerry Secure Communications revenue was **$67M in Q3 FY2026** ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-ltd-bb-q3-2026-050104931.html)). **Corrected 2026-10-02:** $270–280M was the *Secure Communications segment* FY27 guidance, not company revenue. In Sept 2026 (Q2 FY27) BlackBerry **cut** Secure Comms FY27 guidance to **$260–270M**, citing US federal uncertainty and Canada–US trade tensions, while **raising company FY27 revenue guidance to $616–636M** on QNX. Secure Comms Q2 FY27 revenue $60.9M; ARR $221M ([Yahoo/Zacks](https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/stocks/articles/bb-q2-earnings-top-sales-130400989.html), [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4646823-blackberry-forecasts-fy2027-revenue-of-616m-636m-while-lifting-adjusted-ebitda-outlook-to)) (verified 2026-10-02) | Shows the durable business is *software on commodity devices* with a sovereign accreditation |
| **Airbus secure mobile** | Airbus sells Tetrapol/Tactilon secure-mobility products | Not researched in depth | — | Open question |

**Contradiction resolved (2026-10-02).** The "$270–280M" figure was Secure Communications segment guidance, as suspected. Company-wide FY27 guidance is $616–636M, and segment guidance was cut to $260–270M in September 2026 ([Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4646823-blackberry-forecasts-fy2027-revenue-of-616m-636m-while-lifting-adjusted-ebitda-outlook-to), [Yahoo/Zacks](https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/stocks/articles/bb-q2-earnings-top-sales-130400989.html)).

## A3. De-Googled and privacy operating systems (consumer/prosumer)

| OS | Organization | Model | Scale / funding | 2025–2026 events |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **GrapheneOS** | GrapheneOS Foundation (non-profit, Canada) | Pixel-only until now. Uses Pixel verified boot with custom keys | Donation-funded | Said in **Oct 2025** it had worked with a "major Android OEM" since June 2025 ([Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/graphene-os-major-android-oem-partnership-3606853/)). **Motorola announced a long-term partnership at MWC, March 2026**, ending Pixel exclusivity. Official support on Motorola devices is expected in **2027** ([Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/grapheneos-motorola-partnership-announced-3645710/); [PhoneArena](https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-has-partnered-with-grapheneos_id178609)) |
| **CalyxOS** | Calyx Institute (non-profit) | Pixel/Fairphone; microG | Non-profit | Releases **paused 1 Aug 2025** after the founder and tech lead left ([LWN](https://lwn.net/Articles/1033042/); [heise](https://www.heise.de/en/news/CalyxOS-Android-Custom-ROM-with-massive-problems-10510111.html)). Development resumed July 2026. Latest release 12 Sept 2026 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalyxOS)) |
| **/e/OS (Murena)** | Murena SAS (France) / e Foundation | Sells phones with /e/OS preinstalled (Fairphone, Pixel, SHIFT, Gigaset) | Crowdcube raise of **€753,597 from 511 investors, June 2024** ([Crowdcube](https://www.crowdcube.eu/companies/murena/pitches/bjgwvq)). **44,000 active users and >19,900 phones sold** by May 2024. **€2.8M net revenue in 2023** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/_(operating_system))) | /e/OS v4.0 and Gigaset as a supplier, June 2026 (same source) |

**Takeaway.** The whole de-Googled market is in the tens of thousands of paying users. GrapheneOS has the strongest security reputation. It has no commercial arm, and it is now tied to Motorola. The CalyxOS pause shows that the key-custody and governance risk in small OS projects is real: its signing infrastructure had to be overhauled after two people left.

## A4. US DoD, virtual mobile and CSfC

**Implication.** The US DoD is moving away from issued hardware and toward "no data on device" virtualization on personal phones. A new dedicated phone faces headwinds there unless it is itself NIAP/CSfC-listed and can carry the same virtual workspace. Hypori's funding (~$35M Series B) and contract sizes ($4M–$12M) show what a successful niche vendor in this channel looks like.

**Lessons for Alpha:**

1. A closed "trust us, it's secure" phone with a proprietary back end is exactly the architecture that failed or was operated by the adversary (ANOM). Credibility has to come from verifiable openness: published measurements, reproducible builds and third-party audits.
2. A secure phone sold to anonymous, high-paying buyers attracts law-enforcement scrutiny and reputational contamination. Know-your-customer controls and a legitimate buyer base (enterprise and government) matter.
3. Centralized key or back-end control is the single point of compromise. Alpha's KMS key policy and enclave signer are exactly that point (see Part C).

**NVIDIA GPU confidential computing.** Hopper (H100/H200) introduced CC mode. Blackwell adds TEE-I/O and multi-GPU protected links (est. from vendor materials). Measured overhead:

- NVIDIA and independent benchmarks: **<5%** for most LLM inference on H100 ([arXiv 2409.03992](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.03992v3)).
- A 2026 Blackwell study: **~1–3%** when tuned, but **30–40%** with stock stacks. Overhead sits on host-to-device and GPU-to-GPU links ([arXiv 2608.26575](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2608.26575)).
- Attestation costs **~1–3 s** once at provisioning ([Spheron](https://www.spheron.network/blog/confidential-gpu-computing-nvidia-tee-encrypted-vram/)).

**Conclusion:** confidentiality for open-weight model inference now has a small performance cost. The main costs are operational: attestation plumbing, capacity and giving up specialized accelerators such as Cerebras.

The capability is no longer exotic, and Alpha can buy it or build it.

## B3. Market size estimates for confidential computing

| Source | Estimate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MarketsandMarkets (May 2023) | **$59.4B by 2028, 62.1% CAGR** (est.) | [MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/confidential-computing-market-78284924.html) |
| Fortune Business Insights | **$24.24B (2025) → $42.74B (2026) → $463.89B (2034), 34.7% CAGR** (est.). North America 51% | [Fortune BI](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/confidential-computing-market-107794) |

**Caution.** These reports define the market broadly. They count all TEE-capable hardware and cloud revenue, not incremental spend on confidentiality. Treat them as upper bounds. Their 2028 figures differ by several times. A *direct* confidential-AI-inference services market is a small fraction of these totals. The funding and revenue of startups above (Fortanix ~$25M revenue; most others pre-revenue or under $1M) is consistent with a few hundred million dollars in pure-play spend today (est.).

## B4. TEE attacks, and what attestation actually proves

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SGX side-channel lineage (Foreshadow, Plundervolt, ÆPIC, xAPIC/MMIO) | 2018–2022 | Intel SGX | Software (plus microcode lag) | Key extraction. BIOS/TCB patches take ~2 months on average to reach vendors | [sgx.fail](https://sgx.fail/) |

| **MilanLaunchy / BadFuse** | 13 May 2026 | AMD EPYC Milan SEV-SNP | **Software-only** | Extracted the root VCEK seed, allowing forged attestation for any firmware version | [arXiv 2605.12990](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.12990) |

Requires host software control plus brief physical access |

Vendor responses: Intel (security announcement, 28 Oct 2025) and AMD (AMD-SB-3040) say interposer attacks are outside their threat model and that physical security of the data center is the mitigation ([tee.fail](https://tee.fail/); [ddropattack.eu](https://ddropattack.eu/)). Related research shows that CVM attestation does not prove *where* code runs, which enables relay/proxy attacks. "Proof of Cloud" proposes binding CVM attestation to the platform TPM ([arXiv 2510.12469](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12469)).

### What attestation proves, and what it does not

| Attestation proves | Attestation does *not* prove |
| --- | --- |
| A given measured image (hashes) booted on hardware whose key chains to the vendor root (AWS Nitro, AMD, Intel or NVIDIA) | That the measured code is *correct*, non-malicious or leak-free. A hash of a backdoored image verifies just as well ([Trail of Bits, Sept 2026](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/09/25/dont-let-tees-break-your-mpc)) |
| The debug/console mode was off. For Nitro, debug mode gives all-zero PCRs ([AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html)) | That anything outside the measurement is safe: unmeasured runtime downloads, config, environment variables, or the *remote services the code calls* (such as an inference API) |
| For Nitro: the parent IAM role (PCR3), instance (PCR4) and signing certificate (PCR8) | That the operator cannot change *which* images are trusted. Whoever controls the KMS key policy, or the signing key behind PCR8, can admit a new image |
| That the attestation key has not been extracted — **only if hardware assumptions hold** | Physical security. The 2025–2026 interposer attacks forge attestation itself on SGX/TDX/SEV-SNP. Nitro's root is AWS, so the trust assumption is AWS itself, not the silicon |
| — | Freshness and rollback safety of persisted state ([Trail of Bits](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/09/25/dont-let-tees-break-your-mpc)) |
| — | Physical location (proxy attacks) ([arXiv 2510.12469](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12469)) |

**What the platforms add on top of attestation:**

- Apple, Google and Meta each add a **public transparency log or published measurements**, so a user's device refuses nodes whose image is not publicly listed.
- They add **OHTTP / IP-blinding relays** for non-targetability.
- They add **third-party audits** (NCC Group for Google, Meta and AWS Nitro).
- Apple adds a **research VM and bounties**.

Attestation without these is necessary but not sufficient.

# Part C — Analysis: where Alpha sits

## C1. Positioning map

| | Device security | Server-side AI confidentiality | Verifiability to the end user |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bittium / Katim / Secusmart / Cryptosmart | High, nationally accredited | No AI; secure comms | Via government accreditation |
| Samsung Knox / Pixel (NIAP) | High, NIAP/CSfC | Vendor AI (Gemini PAC; Galaxy AI) | Vendor audits |
| GrapheneOS / Murena | High (Graphene) / medium | None; user brings apps | Open source |
| Hypori | Moves data off the device | N/A | DoD IL5 |
| Apple iPhone + PCC | High | **Attested, logged, relayed** | Transparency log, VRE, bounty |
| Pixel 10 + Private AI Compute | High | **Attested TPU/AMD TEE, relayed** | NCC audit; less public logging than Apple (est.) |
| **Alpha Phone (today)** | Stock Pixel hardware; custom launcher/app; Keystore credentials; *not* NIAP-evaluated in its own configuration | **Attested agent runtime (Nitro); unattested inference (Cerebras)**; ASR/TTS on a paired host | Operator-held KMS policy; no public log yet; phone-side verification not evidenced in repo docs |

Alpha's differentiator is not "a secure phone." Bittium and Samsung own that. It is not "private cloud AI" either, where Apple and Google give it away. Alpha's differentiator is a **personal agent with owner-scoped actions whose cloud brain is attestable and auditable by the owner or their organization**, on an ordinary Pixel. That is credible only if the full data path is inside the claim.

## C2. The Nitro-has-no-GPU / Cerebras gap, stated precisely

Facts from the repo ([enclave-candidate-validation.md](../enclave-candidate-validation.md)) and sources:

1. The elizaOS agent runs inside a Nitro Enclave. Its image is measured (PCR0/1/2), signed (PCR8), and bound to an IAM role (PCR3). KMS releases the data key only to enclaves matching the key policy.
2. Text inference is **direct Cerebras `qwen-3.8-27b`**, and the cloud inference proxy is disabled (`ELIZAOS_CLOUD_USE_INFERENCE=false`). *Founder decision (2026-10-02): Qwen stays as the model. Because Qwen is open-weight, the mitigation is to self-host it inside an attested boundary (Option C), redact before any Cerebras hop (Option B), and document weight provenance (hashes of the exact checkpoint used). Qwen's PRC origin stays a buyer concern for some segments (workstream 5).*
3. Nitro Enclaves have no network interface and no PCI/GPU access ([AWS/OneUptime](https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2026-02-12-aws-nitro-enclaves-sensitive-data-processing/view)). All egress, including calls to Cerebras, goes over vsock to the parent EC2 instance, which forwards it.
4. Cerebras's privacy policy (effective 27 Aug 2024) says it does "not retain inputs and outputs" of inference and deletes logs "when they are no longer necessary" ([Cerebras privacy policy](https://www.cerebras.ai/privacy-policy)) (verified 2026-10-02). Cerebras advertises SOC 2 Type 2 and HIPAA through its [Trust Center](https://trust.cerebras.ai/) (vendor claim) and is listed as a zero-data-retention provider by [TrustedRouter](https://trustedrouter.com/providers), which marks its confidential inference as **not verified**. A second search on 2026-10-02 again found **no public Cerebras TEE or attestation offering** (absence of evidence). About 85% of Cerebras capacity is in the US (Santa Clara, Stockton, Dallas, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City), plus Montreal and a planned European site ([BusinessWire, Mar 2025](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250311115186/en/Cerebras-Announces-Six-New-AI-Datacenters-Across-North-America-and-Europe-to-Deliver-Industry-s-Largest-Dedicated-AI-Inference-Cloud)).
5. ASR/TTS (whisper.cpp, Kokoro) currently run on a **paired host**, outside the enclave (manifest baseline).
6. The temporary public ingress is a Cloudflare quick tunnel (`*.trycloudflare.com`), per the validation doc.

What follows, in order of severity:

| # | Data-path segment | Who can see plaintext today | Protection type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Phone → public ingress | **Cloudflare**, if TLS terminates at its edge. That is the default for quick tunnels. It holds unless Alpha adds an application-layer channel keyed to the enclave's attested key. The repo docs neither show nor rule this out | Contractual (Cloudflare) unless there is an attested end-to-end channel |
| 2 | Ingress → parent EC2 → vsock → enclave | **Parent host / operator**, if TLS terminates on the parent rather than inside the enclave | Depends on where TLS terminates; must be inside the enclave |
| 3 | Inside the enclave (agent memory, notes, calendar, tokens) | AWS in theory (the Nitro trust root); the operator only via admitted images | **Attested and cryptographic** (Nitro plus KMS) |
| 4 | Enclave → parent → **Cerebras** (full prompt: system prompt, retrieved memory, notes, email snippets, transcripts) | **Cerebras** (plaintext on arrival); the parent host too, if TLS to Cerebras is not terminated inside the enclave | **Contractual only** (privacy policy); not attested |
| 5 | Voice → paired host ASR/TTS | **The paired host and its operator** | None beyond host security |
| 6 | Admission of new enclave images | **Whoever controls the KMS key policy and the PCR8 signer.** The validation doc shows the operator adding a new PCR0 via Terraform | Governance only; there is no public transparency log |

**Precise conclusions:**

- **Accurate claim today (once the candidate is deployed):** "The agent's runtime, memory and credentials run in an AWS Nitro Enclave. Its key is released only to measured, signed images. Model inference is sent to Cerebras, which contractually does not retain inputs or outputs."
- **Inaccurate claims today:** "attested enclave inference", "data never leaves the trust boundary", "not even we can see your data". The prompt content, which is the sensitive part, leaves the attested boundary in plaintext to a third party on every model call. The operator also controls image admission unilaterally.
- Attestation of the enclave says nothing about Cerebras, because the Cerebras endpoint lies outside the measurement (see B4). Even a *perfect* enclave forwards the secrets outward by design.
- The 2025–2026 DRAM-interposer attacks do not directly target Nitro, because Nitro's isolation is hypervisor-based rather than memory encryption. Nitro's model already requires **trusting AWS** as hardware operator (supported by the NCC 2023 affirmation). For Nitro, "confidential from the cloud provider" is a trust statement about AWS, not a cryptographic guarantee against AWS. That is weaker than PCC-class claims against a physical insider.

## C3. Architectures that would make "data never leaves the trust boundary" defensible

| Option | Description | Confidentiality of inference | Cost / latency | Effort | Claim it supports |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Keep Cerebras; fix the language** | As today, plus a Cerebras DPA/ZDR contract | Contractual | Best latency (Cerebras) | Low | "Attested agent runtime; no-retention inference partner" |
| **B. Redact before Cerebras** | Typed pseudonymization in the enclave (see workstream 04); only tokenized prompts leave; rehydrate inside the enclave | Partial. Reduces identifiers, not semantics | Small overhead | Medium; ADR-02 redaction is not built yet | "Identifiers never leave the enclave" (with measured recall) |
| **C. Attested confidential-GPU inference** | Self-host open-weight Qwen (27B fits on one 80 GB H100/H200 in BF16 (est.)) on **Azure NCC H100 v5** or equivalent, with the exact weight hashes published as provenance. Privatemode already lists Qwen among its models. Alternatively, call an attested provider (Tinfoil, Privatemode, Phala). The enclave verifies the GPU/CVM attestation and pins its measurement before sending, then terminates TLS inside both TEEs | Cryptographic, with the hardware caveats in B4 | Throughput cost <5% ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.03992v3)), but loses Cerebras speed. GPU capacity cost: Azure NCC40ads H100 v5 about **$8.90/hr** on demand vs about $6.98 for the non-confidential NCads H100 v5 (per a competitor's comparison, [VoltageGPU](https://voltagegpu.com/compare/confidential-gpu-clouds); not checked against Azure's price sheet) | Medium-high. Cross-cloud (AWS↔Azure) attestation chaining | "Prompts are processed only inside attested hardware" |
| **D. Move the whole agent into a CPU+GPU CVM** | Replace Nitro with SEV-SNP/TDX CVM plus NVIDIA CC on one host (the Azure, Google and Meta pattern) | Cryptographic, one attestation domain | As in C | High (re-platform) | Same as C, simpler chain |
| **E. On-device inference / hybrid** | Small model plus ASR/TTS on the Pixel 10 Tensor G5 (workstream 10); cloud only for hard tasks, routed through C | Strongest for on-device tasks | Battery and quality limits | High | "Most requests never leave the phone" |

**Minimum set for a defensible "never leaves the trust boundary" claim (independent of A–E):**

1. **End-to-end channel from phone to enclave.** The phone verifies the Nitro attestation document (AWS root cert chain, PCR0/1/2/8, nonce) and encrypts to a key bound in that document. That removes Cloudflare and the parent host from the plaintext path. Replace the quick tunnel.
2. **Every hop that sees plaintext is attested and pinned.** This includes inference (C/D) and ASR/TTS (on device or inside a TEE).
3. **Public release transparency.** Publish every admitted PCR0/PCR8, with reproducible-build recipes, to an append-only log, in the style of Apple PCC and OpenPCC ([Confident Security](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251105013372/en/Confident-Security-Launches-OpenPCC-an-Open-Source-Standard-that-Protects-Data-Shared-with-AI-Models)). The phone refuses unlisted images.
4. **Separation of admission power.** Use multi-party approval, or a delay-and-notify step, for KMS key-policy changes. The validation doc's "signer" and "Terraform owner" roles are the current single points of control.
5. **Non-targetability (optional but PCC-class).** An OHTTP relay run by a third party, so the operator cannot route a specific user to a special node.
6. **Third-party audit plus bounty,** following NCC-style reviews of Meta and Google.
7. **Honest threat model.** State that AWS (Nitro) and NVIDIA/AMD/Intel silicon are trusted, and that physical-interposer attacks are out of scope, with a link to B4.

## Implications for Alpha Phone

1. **Do not market Alpha as a "secure phone" against Bittium, Katim, Secusmart, Knox or GrapheneOS.** Alpha has no NIAP/CSfC evaluation of its own configuration. The HOME-launcher/AOSP add-on is not the validated stock-Pixel configuration. The US DoD is moving to BYOD plus Hypori. Position Alpha as a **verifiable personal agent** that runs on a NIAP-validated Pixel.
2. **Fix the confidentiality claim now.** Replace "attested enclave inference" with the accurate sentence in C2 until inference is attested. Apple, Google and Meta have set the bar (transparency log, relays, audits). An overstated claim is a reputational risk that sophisticated buyers and researchers will find. The criminal-cryptophone history shows how "trust us" architectures end.
3. **The quickest real upgrade is Option C.** Qwen is open-weight, so move inference to confidential GPUs, either self-hosted or through an attested provider (Privatemode is EU/BSI-oriented; Tinfoil is US). Keep Cerebras as an opt-in "fast lane" with explicit disclosure, or put redaction (Option B) in front of it.
4. **Close the non-inference leaks.** Ensure TLS/app-layer encryption terminates inside the enclave (not at Cloudflare or the parent host). Move ASR/TTS on device (already an MVP requirement).
5. **Build the transparency layer.** Publish PCRs, reproducible builds, a public log and phone-side verification, and add multi-party admission control. Small teams (Tinfoil, 5 people; Confident Security, ~$4M) have done this. It is also a sellable enterprise feature: customers can pin their own allowed measurements.
6. **Sovereign and national channels are where secure-mobile money is** (BSI, ANSSI, UAE/EDGE, Finland). An EU deployment on attested EU GPUs (the Privatemode/C5 pattern) could open German and French public-sector pilots. Nitro-in-us-east-2 plus a US inference vendor will not.
7. **Budget for certification, not hardware.** The comparables that survive (Secusmart, Cryptosmart, Hypori) earn money from accredited software on commodity devices, at $4M–$12M contract sizes (Hypori) and ~$270M/year revenue at scale (BlackBerry Secure Comms).

## Open questions

1. Does the Alpha phone verify the Nitro attestation document itself (root chain, PCRs, nonce), or does it trust the endpoint? Where does TLS from the phone terminate: at the Cloudflare edge, on the parent host, or inside the enclave?
2. Does the TLS session to Cerebras terminate inside the enclave (with the parent only proxying bytes over vsock), or on the parent instance?
3. What exactly does each Cerebras call contain (memory, notes, email, transcripts)? Is there a signed DPA or zero-retention addendum beyond the public privacy policy? Where are Cerebras's inference data centers?
4. Does Cerebras have any roadmap for TEE or attestation on its inference service? No public evidence was found (re-checked 2026-10-02). Its privacy policy confirms no retention of inputs/outputs; a signed DPA/BAA must still be obtained directly.
5. Who can change the KMS key policy and the PCR8 signer? Can those changes be published to a user-visible log, or made subject to multi-party approval?
6. Is Qwen-class quality and latency on confidential H100/H200/B200 acceptable against Cerebras for Alpha's UX? What is the cost per active user per month (est.)?
7. Would Alpha's own configuration (custom HOME launcher / AOSP add-on on Pixel 10) keep the Pixel's NIAP MDFPP status, or need a new evaluation? What about DoDIN APL, given that Pixel 10 is not listed yet?
8. Is a GrapheneOS/Motorola-based variant (2027) a better base for a hardened Alpha SKU than stock Pixel? (Partnership confirmed at MWC 2026; first Motorola devices in 2027, non-folding first ([Android Central](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/waiting-for-grapheneos-motorolas-2027-phones-are-up-first-and-foldables-are-included)) (verified 2026-10-02).) *Note (founder decision 2026-10-02): Alpha forks AOSP and does not need GMS, Play Integrity or banking apps, so the usual GrapheneOS-style objection (banking apps failing Play Integrity) is a non-issue for Alpha.*
9. *Resolved 2026-10-02:* Zama, Nillion, Duality, Enveil, Sirin ICO, BlackBerry segment vs company guidance, Google PAC date (11 Nov 2025), Tinfoil funding (database-level). Still could not verify: Boeing Black end-of-life, Tinfoil first-year revenue.
10. Not covered in depth (search budget exhausted): Cog Systems, SecurePhone, Airbus secure mobile, Zebra/Getac, Lucid, and CSfC Mobile Access Capability Package specifics. Assign follow-up if these matter for vertical 06.

**Founder decisions applied:**
- **Model (revised 2026-10-02):** Qwen stays. C2 fact 2 now notes that the mitigation is self-hosting the open Qwen weights inside an attested boundary, redacting before egress, and publishing weight provenance. Option C and Implication 3 keep Qwen. The core finding is unchanged: inference at Cerebras is outside the attested boundary.
- **AOSP fork without GMS:** Open Q8 notes that Play Integrity and banking-app breakage, the usual objection to GrapheneOS-style bases, is a non-issue for Alpha.

**Not re-checked:** Bittium, Katim, Purism, Hypori, Sonim, EncroChat/Sky ECC/ANOM figures, Fortanix, Anjuna, OPAQUE and Edgeless rounds, and the market-size reports. These already carried source links and were not flagged unverified.
