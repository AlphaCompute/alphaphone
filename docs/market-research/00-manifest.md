# 00 — Scope and coverage

This document defines the scope of the Alpha Phone research: the product baseline every section assumes, the questions each section answers, and the topics outside the original request that the research covers. The consolidated findings are in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md).

Product capability statements come from the repository's evidence ledger (`docs/mvp-scope-and-gap-report.md`, `docs/mvp-current-status.md`, `docs/enclave-candidate-validation.md`). Where a capability is only planned, the research says so.

## Product baseline

| Attribute | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Alpha forks AOSP for its own signed image. Banking apps, Play Integrity and GMS are not requirements. |
| Form factor | Android phone UI (Pixel 10 or similar target), in standalone-app and HOME-launcher flavors; an additive, non-privileged AOSP vendor add-on is generated. The full signed image has not been qualified on a physical device. |
| Agent runtime | elizaOS agent, owner-paired, running on the phone (Android-resident). Only model requests leave the device. Inference is Qwen (`qwen-3.8-27b`) on Cerebras. The earlier AWS Nitro Enclaves deployment is no longer the agent runtime. |
| Voice | Native capture and playback on the phone. ASR/TTS (whisper.cpp tiny.en, Kokoro) currently run on a paired host. On-device STT/TTS is an MVP requirement that is not yet met. |
| Daily tools | Notes, transcription, calendar CRUD, reminders and alarms, browser with a password-provider integration, files, camera and photos, maps handoff, workflows, digests, notifications and inbox. Gmail is recommended. |
| Deferred | Phone, SMS and contacts integration; wallet and payments; offline LLM; Telegram and Discord. |
| Security posture | Android Keystore AES-GCM credential storage, no backup, owner-scoped pairing, and explicit approvals and receipts for native actions. Model inference on Cerebras is covered by a contractual no-retention commitment, not attestation. Redaction is named as a shared upstream contract in ADR-02; the upstream secret/PII swap is enabled for the resident agent, and the full redaction pipeline is not yet built. |
| Design | Alpha Compute brand: white/black with electric blue #0000FF, Fraunces/Denton serif and Public Sans. The prototype has 14 app modules. |

## Topics outside the original request

Each topic is covered in the sections listed in parentheses.

- Recording-consent law (all-party-consent states and the EU) as a gating feature (05, 10)
- Biometric voiceprints under BIPA/CUBI when diarizing speakers (05, 10)
- Bystander privacy and a social-acceptability "recording" indicator (Humane/Friend backlash) (01, 02, 11)
- Recordkeeping obligations: finance must retain, not only redact. Retention can conflict with redaction (04, 05, 06)
- Legal holds and e-discovery for transcripts; privilege waiver when privileged speech reaches a third party's AI (05, 06)
- Export controls on encryption and AI (EAR 5A002, ITAR if defense-modified) (05, 09)
- Supply chain and origin requirements: TAA, NDAA §889, trusted-foundry style and "China-free" BOMs (03, 05, 09)
- Google GMS/MADA licensing versus de-Googled AOSP. Play Integrity breaks banking apps, which are out of scope for Alpha's image (09, 11)
- Pixel bootloader and verified-boot custom keys (GrapheneOS model) (03, 09)
- Wake-word patents and speech-model licensing (Whisper MIT, Parakeet CC-BY) (10, 11)
- Brand trust: elizaOS/ai16z crypto association as an asset for some investors and a liability with government buyers (08, 11)
- Insurance and liability for redaction false negatives (04, 11)
- Alternative form factors: a companion pendant or desk puck versus a full phone, and BYOD app versus dedicated device (02, 10, 11)
- Channel conflict with Apple and Google bundling free recorders and summaries (01, 02, 11)
- Hiring and certification capacity (FIPS, CC and FedRAMP take 12–24 months) (05, 11)
- Pricing: hardware-plus-subscription versus seat-based versus enclave-inference metering (09, 11)
