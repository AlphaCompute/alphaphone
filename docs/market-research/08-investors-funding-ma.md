## How to read this file

- **Evidence labels.** Every figure has a source URL. Figures marked **(est.)** are analyst estimates, derived multiples or check-size ranges. Figures marked **(unverified)** come from earlier press coverage that this session could not re-fetch. Confirm them before they appear in a deck. **(reported)** marks press reports that the company did not confirm. **(denied)** marks reports that the company denied.
- **Method limit.** The session's shared web-search quota ran out after 12 searches. The rest of the research used about 80 direct page fetches (TechCrunch article and tag pages, Wikipedia, company sites, SEC EDGAR, stockanalysis.com, CoinGecko, The Block, and government program sites). For some companies no primary page could be fetched, including Even Realities, Halliday, Fathom, Jump, Anjuna, Tinfoil, Katim and Sirin. Those rows say what is missing and do not guess.
- **Dates.** Round dates are announcement dates unless marked otherwise. Stock and token prices were refreshed on 2026-10-02.
- **Fact-check pass (2026-10-02).** Web search was available for a second pass. Items marked "(verified 2026-10-02)" were confirmed against SEC EDGAR, company releases or reputable press; "(could not verify)" marks items still unconfirmed. See the verification log at the end.
- **Facts versus inference.** Sections 1–6 are facts with sources. Sections 7–10 are analysis and recommendations.

## 0. Executive summary

1. **The issuer is a Nasdaq microcap, and that is the capital-strategy problem to solve first.** `alphatoncapital.com` 301-redirects to `alphacompute.ai` ([fetch](https://alphatoncapital.com)). SEC EDGAR lists **Alpha Compute Corp** (CIK 0001095435), formerly AlphaTON Capital Corp (legal name changed effective 2026-04-14; ticker ATON → ALP on 2026-04-21), before that Portage Biotech (name used until 2025-09), Bontan and DealCheck.com ([EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001095435&type=&dateb=&owner=include&count=40), [20-F/A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001095435/000117184326005284/f20fa_072626.htm); verified 2026-10-02). The FY2026 (year to 2026-03-31) 20-F/A carries an auditor **going-concern** paragraph and a **−$38.6M net loss**. On 2026-10-02 the company (NASDAQ: ALP) had a **≈$7.0M market cap** (about 1.55M shares at $4.54; the 2026-09-30 figure of $2.29M used a stale 469K share count), **$507K cash** (last reported balance sheet), **−$20.55M TTM operating cash flow**, **$97K TTM revenue** and **2 employees** (data-aggregator figures; employee count not confirmed in filings) ([stockanalysis statistics](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/alp/statistics/)). A **1:50 reverse split took effect 2026-09-09** and Nasdaq bid-price compliance was regained on 2026-09-25 ([6-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001095435/000117184326006237/exh_991.htm); verified 2026-10-02). The repository's brand assets come from alphacompute.ai (`design-assets/README.md`). *Inference:* the phone is very likely an Alpha Compute Corp product. The parent cannot fund a phone program from its balance sheet, so Alpha Phone needs its own financing vehicle.
2. **elizaOS token heritage is now a liability to disclose, not a funding source.** A federal class action (*Doe v. Walters*, No. 1:26-cv-03238, S.D.N.Y., filed 2026-04-22 by Burwick Law) was, per Walters' public statements, settled by transferring the remaining foundation treasury to the plaintiff group; settlement amounts were not disclosed. On **2026-08-05** Shaw Walters declared the token "dead" and said the foundation would wind down ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/410774/eliza-labs-native-token-dead), [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/08/05/ai-agent-token-once-worth-usd2-4-billion-ends-with-founder-calling-it-dead), [Burwick](https://www.burwick.law/insights/burwick-law-files-class-action-over-ai16z-and-elizaos-tokens); verified 2026-10-02). ELIZAOS trades at about a **$1.17M market cap** (2026-10-02), down 98.5% from its all-time high ([CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/elizaos)). The open-source framework continues ([elizaresearch.ai](https://elizaresearch.ai/)).
3. **Device comps split sharply by outcome.** Humane raised $230M and sold its assets for $116M, about 0.5x capital ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/humanes-ai-pin-is-dead-as-hp-buys-startups-assets-for-116m/)). Limitless (>$33M raised) and Bee ($7M raised) were acqui-hired at undisclosed prices ([TC](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/meta-acquires-ai-device-startup-limitless/), [TC](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/amazon-acquires-bee-the-ai-wearable-that-records-everything-you-say/)). Plaud reached about $250M annualized revenue on roughly $5M of outside capital ([Sacra](https://sacra.com/c/plaud/)). io sold to OpenAI for $6.5B ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/openai-closes-6-5-billion-deal-to-buy-jony-ive-s-device-startup)).
4. **Software-plus-workflow comps carry the richest multiples.** Abridge raised at **$5.3B** on **$117M contracted ARR**, about 45x (est.) ([TC](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/in-just-4-months-ai-medical-scribe-abridge-doubles-valuation-to-5-3b/)). Granola raised at **$1.5B**, 6x its prior round in under a year ([TC](https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/25/granola-raises-125m-hits-1-5b-valuation-as-it-expands-from-meeting-notetaker-to-enterprise-ai-app/)).
5. **Defense capital is abundant, and the SBIR lapse is over.** SBIR/STTR authority lapsed for about 6 months. It was reauthorized in April 2026 by the Small Business Innovation and Economic Security Act and now runs **through 2031-09-30** ([DefenseScoop](https://defensescoop.com/2026/04/29/sbir-sttr-americas-seed-fund-is-being-revamped-for-modern-warfare/)). Anduril raised $5B at $61B in May 2026 ([TC](https://techcrunch.com/2026/05/13/anduril-raises-5b-doubles-valuation-to-61b/)). **Eligibility is the catch.** A subsidiary of a BVI-incorporated public parent may fail SBIR's US ownership test and DoD foreign-ownership (FOCI) review unless it is structured for them.
6. **Recommended structure (inference):** form a US Delaware C-corp "Alpha Phone NewCo" with a clean cap table and a US-person majority, license IP from the parent and elizaOS (MIT), and raise a **$4–8M seed (est.)**. Lead with privacy, security and defense seed funds plus one strategic corporate VC, and run SBIR, DIU and AFWERX in parallel.

| Phone or elizaOS mentioned on the corporate site or in filings? | **No.** The homepage shows no phone, elizaOS, TON or product pages, only IR and press contacts. The FY2026 20-F/A contains no mention of a phone, Alpha Phone, elizaOS, Eliza or Shaw Walters, and no related-party disclosure involving them (checked 2026-10-02) | 2026-10 | [alphacompute.ai](https://www.alphacompute.ai/), [20-F/A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001095435/000117184326005284/f20fa_072626.htm) |

**No disclosed financing specific to Alpha Phone was found.** Neither the corporate site nor the investor page describes a phone program or its funding ([alphacompute.ai/investors](https://alphacompute.ai/investors)). The 424B3 filings show that the parent sells registered securities. Their amounts and uses were not extracted in this pass (open question).

**Why this matters (inference):**
- **Dilution and signalling.** At a ≈$7M market cap with a going-concern opinion, any meaningful phone budget, even $5M (est.), is roughly 70% of the parent's equity value. Funding it at the parent would be heavily dilutive and would signal distress to enterprise and government buyers.
- **Disclosure.** A public parent must disclose material developments (6-K). Pilots with government customers and fundraising talks become material-information management problems.
- **Foreign ownership (FOCI) and SBIR.** SBIR/STTR awardees must be majority-owned and controlled by US citizens or permanent residents (or eligible US entities), with 500 or fewer employees including affiliates. Majority ownership by multiple VC/PE firms is allowed only if no single fund owns more than 50% (program rule, verified 2026-10-02; [SBA eligibility guide](https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf), [Army SBIR](https://armysbir.army.mil/eligibility/)). A wholly owned subsidiary of a BVI parent is likely ineligible. For DoD classified work, a BVI parent triggers FOCI mitigation. The US subsidiary needs a US-person majority, or at least a proxy or SSA-style mitigation plan (inference).
- **Reputation.** The CEO is publicly known for the Cambridge Analytica whistleblowing and later data-rights and open-source-AI advocacy. In Feb 2025 she co-founded the Open Source AI Foundation ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Kaiser)). That can be an asset in a privacy narrative. Government and regulated buyers will diligence it either way, so be ready for questions.

| Class action | *Doe v. Walters*, No. 1:26-cv-03238 (S.D.N.Y.), filed 2026-04-22 by Burwick Law. Defendants: Shaw Walters, Eliza Labs, Inc., Sebastian Quinn-Watson, the ai16z DAO, DAOs.fun and several pseudonymous individuals. Claims under NY GBL §349 and §350, negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment, including "autonomous, AI-run venture fund" marketing and dilution in the migration. **Settled** (per Walters, as reported) by transferring the remaining treasury to the plaintiff group; terms and amounts undisclosed. Walters: "we didn't have the capital to legally fight it" (verified 2026-10-02) | 2026-04-22 → settled by 2026-08 | [Burwick](https://www.burwick.law/insights/burwick-law-files-class-action-over-ai16z-and-elizaos-tokens), [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/08/05/ai-agent-token-once-worth-usd2-4-billion-ends-with-founder-calling-it-dead), [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/410774/eliza-labs-native-token-dead) |
| Foundation wind-down | No further support, buybacks or supply measures.

| Current steward | Eliza Research (elizaresearch.ai). Products: Eliza (personal agent) and slop.cash. The site mentions no token, DAO or funding | 2026-09-30 | [elizaresearch.ai](https://elizaresearch.ai/) |
| Venture funding for Eliza Labs or Eliza Research | **Nothing found** in this session. Do not claim any | — | — |
| Name confusion | The "ai16z" name parodied a16z (Andreessen Horowitz). According to the complaint and CoinDesk, a16z **publicly demanded on 2025-01-28 that the project stop using its branding**, which drove the rename to elizaOS. No a16z investment in ai16z or elizaOS was found (searched 2026-10-02). Decks must not imply an a16z connection | 2025-01 | [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/08/05/ai-agent-token-once-worth-usd2-4-billion-ends-with-founder-calling-it-dead), [Burwick](https://www.burwick.law/insights/burwick-law-files-class-action-over-ai16z-and-elizaos-tokens) |

**Investor-facing framing (inference):** elizaOS is an MIT-licensed, widely forked agent framework with a large developer community. That is useful as distribution and talent. The token is dead and litigated. Say so plainly in the data room. Do not market "crypto-native" to government, defense, healthcare or finance buyers. Crypto funds may still like the developer community, but the Burwick case makes token-linked terms (warrants, airdrops) non-starters. **Do not issue a token.**

| Opaque | $300M post / $24M B | ≈8% dilution | [opaque.co](https://www.opaque.co/) |

**Takeaway (inference):** investors pay software and workflow multiples (Abridge, Granola) for **vertical workflow lock-in plus ARR**. They pay hardware multiples (about 1–2x revenue) for devices. Pure-device companies with weak retention are priced at recovery value (Humane) or acqui-hired (Limitless, Bee). Alpha must be valued as **secure agent software with an attested runtime that happens to ship on a phone**, not as a phone OEM.

### 3.1 Patterns

1. **Wearable-recorder exits are acqui-hires.** Meta–Limitless and Amazon–Bee did not disclose prices, and the hardware was killed. HP–Humane recovered about half the capital raised. The asset bought was **team plus IP plus data pipeline**, not the device business ([Sacra](https://sacra.com/research/why-meta-bought-limitless/)).
2. **AI-security tuck-ins cluster at about $250–350M (press reports, verified 2026-10-02) for companies that had raised roughly $20–30M** (Prompt ≈$23M raised, Aim ≈$28M, Lakera) with a runtime AI-DLP, prompt-injection or agent-governance product. That is the strongest precedent for a **redaction plus agent-governance layer** (see [04](04-redaction.md), when written) as a standalone exit path.
3. **Strategic premiums go to scarce teams in platform races.** Examples are io ($6.5B), Q.ai (≈$2B), Manus ($0.5–1B) and Glass Imaging (>$300M, about 10x capital). OpenAI's reported phone effort (Glass Imaging) and Meta's wearables push are live demand signals for **phone-level agent and OS talent**.
4. **Healthcare documentation carries the largest precedent in the space.** Microsoft–Nuance at $19.7B anchors any healthcare-scribe exit story.
5. **Defense primes and neo-primes prefer tuck-ins of comms, edge compute and sensors** (Anduril–Klas). A hardened, attested agent endpoint fits this pattern if it holds DoD accreditation (NIAP, CSfC). Without accreditation it does not.

### 3.2 Likely acquirers of Alpha (inference, ranked by fit)

| # | Acquirer | Rationale | What would need to be true | Precedent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Hypori** or a secure-mobility consolidator (e.g., Samsung Knox / Samsung Tactical, BlackBerry-style secure comms) | Adds an attested agent and on-device redaction to a FedRAMP High, IL4/5 virtual-mobile base | NIAP / CSfC path started; DoD pilot | [hypori.com](https://www.hypori.com/) |
| 2 | **Anduril** (Lattice ecosystem) or **Palantir** (partnership or minority stake more likely) | A trusted edge agent endpoint for warfighter or analyst workflows | Tactical use case, ATO | Anduril–Klas ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries)) |
| 3 | **Qualcomm** | Showcase for on-device agent and confidential compute on Snapdragon. Developer-ecosystem buyer (Arduino, Edge Impulse, Modular) | Snapdragon-first build; developer traction via elizaOS | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm) |
| 4 | **Samsung** (Knox / Galaxy AI) | A privacy-first enterprise agent layer for Knox and Tactical Edition | Android portability; Knox integration | Viv Labs (≈$215M, 2016) |
| 5 | **OpenAI** | Rumored phone program (io, Glass Imaging) needs Android and agent-OS talent | Team quality; shipped device software | [TC](https://techcrunch.com/2026/09/14/openai-buys-smartphone-camera-maker-glass-imaging-for-300-million-report-says/) |
| 6 | **Meta / Amazon / Google** | Agent and ambient talent; acqui-hire pattern | Unlikely at a premium (they buy teams, then kill products) | Limitless, Bee |
| 7 | **HP (HP IQ) / Dell / Lenovo** | Future-of-work device ecosystem; HP already owns CosmOS | Enterprise pilots | HP–Humane |
| 8 | **Cybersecurity platforms** (SentinelOne, Check Point, Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, Zscaler, Cato) | Mobile endpoint AI-DLP, redaction and agent-governance tuck-in | Redaction and policy engine separable from the phone | Prompt, Lakera, Aim |
| 9 | **Healthcare documentation** (Microsoft/Nuance, Abridge, Epic partners) | HIPAA-grade ambient capture device with on-device redaction | Clinical pilots, BAA | Nuance |
| 10 | **Finance compliance archiving** (Smarsh, Global Relay, Theta Lake, LeapXpert) | A compliant capture endpoint that solves off-channel communications | FINRA/SEC retention integration | see [05](05-regulation-compliance.md) |
| 11 | **Sovereign / Gulf** (EDGE/Katim, G42, e&) | Sovereign agent phone with local enclave | Localization; export licensing | Katim |
| 12 | **NVIDIA** | Confidential AI and agent stack (Gretel pattern) | Enclave inference IP | Gretel |

## 6. Investor sentiment on AI hardware (2025–2026)

**Signals from the evidence:**

| Signal | Evidence | Read-through |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone AI gadgets failed commercially | Humane shipped ~10K units against a 100K target, with more returns than sales from May–Aug 2024, then sold for about 0.5x capital ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Inc.)). Rabbit had ~5K daily actives out of ~100K buyers ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_r1)) | "Replace the phone" pitches face heavy skepticism |
| Pendants absorbed by platforms | Meta–Limitless, Amazon–Bee. Sacra calls it "the death of the category" ([Sacra](https://sacra.com/research/why-meta-bought-limitless/)) | Features migrate into glasses, earbuds, watches and phones |
| Narrow-job hardware plus subscriptions works | Plaud: ~$250M annualized revenue, >2M units, $100M+ software ARR, almost no VC money ([Sacra](https://sacra.com/c/plaud/)) | Investors reward **one killer job, a clear price and a subscription attach** |
| Platform owners are doubling down | Meta launched camera-free audio AI glasses and the Muse Charm in Sep 2026 ([TC](https://techcrunch.com/category/hardware/)). OpenAI bought io ($6.5B) and Glass Imaging (>$300M) | Big tech will own mass consumer AI hardware. Startups must go vertical or enterprise |
| Big rounds for voice and hardware teams | Sesame $250M (≈$1.19B), Sandbar $23M A, Nothing $200M at $1.3B | Capital exists for **exceptional teams with a novel interaction model** |
| Public-market hardware window closed | Oura shelved its $2.2B IPO (2026-09-29) ([TC](https://techcrunch.com/2026/09/29/oura-shelves-its-2-2b-ipo-citing-uncertainty-in-the-market/)) | Late-stage investors will discount hardware exits |
| Defense and security is hot | Anduril at $61B (talks at $100B), Helsing $18B, Castelion $13B, $52M defense seeds | Security and sovereignty narratives attract capital. Accreditation plus pilots are the gating proof |
| Workflow-software multiples | Abridge ≈45x ARR; Granola 6x step-up | Vertical workflow and compliance lock-in is what is valued |

### 6.1 How to pitch around the Humane and Rabbit overhang (inference)

1. **"Not a new gadget. A trusted endpoint for an agent you can audit."** Alpha runs on standard Android hardware (a Pixel-class target) with a standalone-app and launcher option. It does not ask users to give up their phone for an unfinished device. Pitch the **app/BYOD mode first and the dedicated device as the regulated-customer SKU**.
2. **Lead with the attested enclave and verifiable privacy.** This is the Apple Private Cloud Compute pattern, now standardized (Confident Security's OpenPCC) and funded (Opaque at $300M, Tinfoil, Anjuna). Show PCR-measured images and attested KMS key release as a **demo**, and say explicitly that the latest candidate is not yet deployed.
3. **Sell one job to one buyer.** For example: "compliant capture and redacted briefings for regulated professionals," as Plaud and Jump do for their niches. Avoid the general "do everything" claim (the Rabbit LAM lesson).
4. **Show retention, not pre-orders.** Humane's return rate is the objection. Answer with pilot D30/D90 retention and weekly active use.
5. **Separate the brand from the token.** Put §1.2 in the data room and lead with open-source elizaOS developer adoption.
6. **Governance-first story for regulated buyers:** approvals, receipts, owner-scoped pairing, and Keystore storage without backup. These already exist in the repo. The redaction pipeline does **not** exist yet.

### 6.2 Metrics investors expect (est., synthesized from the comps; not a published standard)

| Stage | Round size (est.) | Must-have metrics for this category (est.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-seed / seed | $2–8M (hardware or security seeds of $10–50M exist for star teams, e.g., Terra's $52M defense seed) | Working demo on a real device; **attestation demo end to end**; 3–5 design partners with signed LOIs or paid pilots, at least one regulated (gov, finance or health); a named SBIR/DIU submission; D30 retention above 40% in pilot users (est.); security architecture reviewed by a third party (e.g., Trail of Bits, which audits Tinfoil); a clear hardware strategy (BYOD or COTS, not custom silicon) |
| Series A | $15–30M (Sandbar $23M A; Granola $43M B at $250M) | **$1–3M ARR** or contracted revenue (est.); 2+ paying enterprise or agency customers with expansion; net revenue retention above 110%; gross margin above 60% blended, with software attach above 50% of revenue; certification progress (FIPS 140-3 module selected, NIAP MDF / CSfC path, SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA BAA); unit economics per seat including enclave inference cost; a funnel of 10+ qualified regulated pilots |
| Series B | $40–100M | $10M+ ARR; ATO or authorization in at least one agency; channel (carrier, GSA/SEWP, MDM partner) producing more than 30% of pipeline (est.) |

## 7. Implications for Alpha Phone

1. **Fix the vehicle before the pitch.** The parent (ALP) has $507K cash (last reported), a ≈$7M market cap, −$20.6M operating cash flow and an auditor going-concern paragraph in its FY2026 20-F/A. Create a **US Delaware C-corp for Alpha Phone** with a US-person majority, an IP license from the parent, MIT-licensed elizaOS, and a board seat for the parent. This makes SBIR, DIU and IQT eligibility possible, isolates the product from parent distress and 6-K disclosure noise, and gives VCs a clean cap table. Alternatives are a carve-out JV with a strategic (Qualcomm, Samsung, Hypori) or a licensing-first model.
2. **Target raise: $4–8M seed (est.)** plus $1–3M non-dilutive in the first 12 months. Syndicate: one security or defense seed lead (Shield Capital, Decisive Point, Ten Eleven, Cyberstarts, 8VC), one strategic corporate VC (Qualcomm Ventures, Intel Capital or NVentures for confidential compute), and angels from the confidential-compute community. **Do not lead with crypto funds or a token.**
3. **Position against the right comps.** Use the Opaque ($300M), Abridge (≈45x ARR), Jump ($80M B, 27K advisors) and AI-security tuck-in comps (≈$250–350M reported) for valuation logic. Avoid Humane and Rabbit comparisons by presenting a software and governance company with a reference device.
4. **Treat redaction and agent governance as a separable asset.** The Prompt, Lakera and Aim acquisitions show that security platforms pay nine figures for runtime AI-DLP. Build the redaction contract (ADR-02) as a standalone SDK. It protects the downside and widens the acquirer pool.
5. **Map acquirers early.** Hypori or secure-mobility players, Qualcomm, Samsung Knox, Anduril or Palantir partners, and cybersecurity platforms are the realistic buyers. Big-tech consumer buyers typically acqui-hire and shut the product down.
6. **Run the government lane in parallel, and do it honestly.** AFWERX Release 6 is open, xTech is running, and SBIR is secure through 2031. Every submission must separate APK, emulator, AOSP-image and real-device evidence, as `AGENTS.md` requires, and must say that on-device STT/TTS and redaction are not yet built.
7. **Proactively disclose heritage risks** (the token wind-down, the Burwick settlement, the ALP financial position, CEO profile) in a one-page data-room memo. Diligence will surface them anyway.
8. **Keep sovereign and Chinese capital out of the US government entity.** Use a separate international entity for Gulf or sovereign deals (Katim, EDGE, MGX, PIF).

## 8. Open questions

1. **Entity:** Which legal entity owns Alpha Phone's IP today: Alpha Compute Corp (BVI), a US subsidiary, or Eliza Research? What license terms apply between them?
2. **Parent financing:** What were the amounts and uses in the 2026 424B3 prospectuses (four filed 2026-05-22, one 2026-06-04) and the Form D (2026-05-29)? Is any capital earmarked for the phone? *Partly answered 2026-10-02:* the FY2026 20-F/A **does** carry a going-concern paragraph, says the year was funded by private placements, ATM and registered direct offerings, and does not mention a phone.
3. **Relationship:** What is the contractual relationship between Alpha Compute and Eliza Research / Shaw Walters (equity, services, revenue share)? Does the Burwick settlement bind or release any successor entities or IP?
4. **Eligibility:** Could a US NewCo meet the SBIR ownership test and FOCI requirements if the parent keeps a minority stake? What mitigation would DCSA require?
5. **Unverified comps:** *Resolved 2026-10-02* for Otter, Fireflies, Ambience, Suki, Nabla, Zama, Prompt/Lakera/Aim (press-reported prices), Edge Impulse, Samsung–Viv, Fathom, Jump, Even Realities, Halliday and Opaque (2026-02-12). Still open: Nuance revenue base for the 13x multiple; Glass Imaging capital raised; Skyflow lead investor; the Alpha Compute employee count.
6. **Apple–Q.ai (≈$2B, 2026-01-29):** *Answered 2026-10-02:* whispered and silent-speech recognition plus noisy-environment audio enhancement. It is a direct voice-interface comp.
7. **NSIN status:** *Answered 2026-10-02:* folded into DIU (completed fall 2024).
8. **NATO DIANA:** *Partly answered:* €100K phase 1, up to €300K phase 2; the 2026 cohort started January 2026. Next call date still open.
9. **Investor contacts:** Current partner assignments at Razor's Edge, Squadra, Point72 Hyperscale and Shield Capital. Some firm sites did not resolve.
10. **Strategic partners:** Would Qualcomm, Samsung Knox or Hypori take a commercial-plus-equity partnership ahead of a priced round?
11. **Token overhang:** Should holders of the old ELIZAOS token receive any disclosure or communication when Alpha Phone fundraises, to avoid claims of an implied connection?
