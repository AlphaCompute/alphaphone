# Source record — 2026-09-29

## Product inputs

- [Eliza Product Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l6O9s8P5jtzoisotUgyMbcRP-btrN0LbgMLxHV1PBd4/edit): authenticated exports of **Product Vision**, **Design Exploration Plan**, and **On-screen Helper PRD** are in `design/sources/`. Exported separately; comments are not part of the Markdown export. The source remains a work in progress.
- [Alpha Phone prototype](https://alpha-phone-prototype.pages.dev/): HTML, React runtime, dc-lite runtime and both SVG assets preserved in `design/prototype/`.
- Senior-care handoff: in the separate senior-care repository. `design/manifest.json` records original byte hashes.
- `vendor/eliza` is the build-consumed upstream source; `upstream.lock.json` pins it. Current upstream scripts use `.ts`; older local checkouts used `.mjs`. Plans below refer to the pinned `.ts` layout.

## Existing Alpha engineering contracts reviewed

- [#31021 Phone pairing](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/31021): cloud-only Android client, owner/agent credential separation, approved routing adapter, reconnect and background result deduplication.
- [#30844 Android fixes + final build](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/30844): noncanonical identity, no native credential logging, no Firebase startup crash, cancellation of stale reconnect work.
- [#31023 Pixel AOSP](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/31023): Pixel 10 intended; Pixel 11 only with support evidence; local inference excluded from that Alpha scope.

These issues inform the implementation plan. Their historical estimates are not delivery promises and their descriptions do not establish passing verification.

## Source precedence

Current user requirements → current On-screen Helper PRD (senior-care only) → current design decision log → current component sheets → Flow Map narrative → older uploaded prototype/spec. The senior-care PRD must not be applied indiscriminately to Alpha. Alpha's prototype is visual/interaction evidence, not proof of working radio, wallet, attestation, connectors or local models.

## Platform references

- [Android HOME role](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/role/RoleManager#ROLE_HOME): user-selected launcher role.
- [AOSP build-host requirements](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/start/requirements): full OS build is separate from SDK APK compilation.
- [Soong APK import](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/refs/heads/main/java/app_import.go): presigned/preprocessed APK import semantics.
