# Architecture and ownership

October 1 architecture change: the user has selected an **Android-resident agent instead of Nitro/TEE hosting**. The [on-device agent plan](on-device-agent-plan.md) supersedes cloud-only and enclave-primary requirements below. The current implementation runs orchestration locally with an explicitly configured hosted Cerebras model; this is not offline LLM operation. Historical evidence is retained. A powered-off phone cannot execute local schedules; optional remote execution has separate acceptance requirements.

September 30 scope update: the [MVP report](mvp-scope-and-gap-report.md) and [completion plan](mvp-completion-plan.md) govern current priority. Earlier cloud-only/local-model statements do not waive the supplied DoD's on-device STT/TTS requirement; offline LLM and external-versus-TEE inference remain explicitly reconciled there.

Status: daily-tool implementation in progress. Cloud and remote authentication adapters are implemented; the actual local Eliza/Cerebras protocol has been exercised. Live Cloud services and device acceptance remain incomplete. Enclave deployment is historical optional work, not a gate for the primary resident-agent path. Cloud service identity is independent of the selected agent target; see `agent-integration.md` and the flow verification record for exact scope.

## Upstream runtime ownership

`upstream.lock.json` and the `vendor/eliza` submodule identify one reviewed upstream
commit for the renderer helpers, resident runtime and native sources. Runtime
preparation checks out that commit without applying consumer patches. Native
staging records original and generated hashes; only product namespace, icon and
environment wiring are generated locally. Regression tests exercise the pinned
upstream sources directly. Historical patch artifacts remain available in Git
history; the working tree no longer carries a patch series.

## Repository boundaries

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/app/src` | Entire alphaphone UI and interaction source; independent of the other product |
| `android` | Capacitor Activity, native app launcher bridge, standalone/HOME flavors |
| `app.config.json` | Product package identity, display name, version, orientation |
| `vendor/eliza` | Commit-pinned agent, UI helpers, native plugins and OS tooling |
| `docs/eliza-app-baseline-provenance.json` | Historical upstream import provenance; source recoverable from Git |
| `design` | Original product/design evidence and exact hashes |
| `scripts` | Reproducible build, APK inspection, emulator smoke and AOSP staging |
| `docs` | PRD, architecture decisions, implementation/test traceability |

The active shell derives its Capacitor activity lifecycle, splash installation, mixed-content policy and HOME back behavior from Eliza's `packages/app/scripts/mobile/android/templates/main-activity.ts`. It compiles the actual `plugins/plugin-native-system/android` source as a Gradle project and imports its browser-safe TypeScript entry. Product bridges include `DeviceApps` for launcher enumeration/open and build identity, and `DailyApps` for native intent handoffs, document selection and device-local reminders. `DevelopmentAgent` exists only in debug source sets and uses a fixed loopback service through emulator port forwarding; it is not production account authentication. No agent, wallet, credential manager or whole `@elizaos/ui` barrel is bundled into the renderer.

## Decisions

**ADR-01: pin source, do not publish the whole monorepo.** Each product has its own `vendor/eliza` Git submodule and exact lock. This makes unpublished native/OS fixes available while retaining reproducibility. Eliza packages contain workspace protocols, relative build scripts and native asset assumptions; a blanket `npm publish` is neither necessary nor validated. The shell's small registry dependency set has its own npm lock. A future package release needs consumer tests outside the monorepo, rewritten workspace protocols, browser-safe exports, native source packaging and a version compatibility matrix before replacing source pins.

**ADR-02: separate UI, shared platform contracts.** No cross-product imports. Each product owns layouts, tokens, routes, branding, package ID and store/OS metadata. Generic transport, platform capability checks, redaction, task/approval protocol and native plugins belong upstream. Product task policy must be supplied explicitly, not hard-coded into the shared agent.

**ADR-03: two install modes.** `standalone` is an ordinary app with MAIN/LAUNCHER and no HOME filter. `launcher` adds MAIN/HOME/DEFAULT and handles Back/Home at its root. Both use the same product package ID so they are alternate installations, not two simultaneous apps. Alpha and senior-care package IDs are different and can coexist. Debug APKs are signed locally; release outputs are unsigned until controlled signing. The signed launcher APK is prepared for import as a nonprivileged presigned AOSP product app; a full image build and boot remain unverified. System installation alone does not grant accessibility, overlay, dialer, SMS, assistant or signature permissions.

**ADR-04: no implicit privileged bundle.** The new OS staging tool admits a custom APK separately from Eliza's full local-agent system APK. It emits an additive Soong module and product fragment after hash/signer/HOME checks. It does not replace Eliza, Launcher3, SystemUI or Chromium. Device enrollment chooses the default HOME role; production selection/rollback policy is a release gate. Do not remove the stock recovery launcher before that gate.

**ADR-05: execution boundary (revised October 1).** The primary agent runs on the Android device, replacing the earlier cloud-only/Nitro direction. Reuse the existing Eliza mobile runtime and native IPC subject to Alpha packaging, lifecycle and permission qualification. Keep orchestration, durable state and tool approvals local; model inference location is a separate pending decision. Hosted inference, if selected, must be explicit about outbound context. Cloud/remote pairing remains an optional path. The existing debug host-forwarded transport is not an on-device runtime. See [implementation and acceptance changes](on-device-agent-plan.md).

**ADR-06: browser independence.** Assistance to third-party websites needs the isolated native browser surface or approved Chromium bridge; never expose the Capacitor bridge to arbitrary remote web content. Origin identity, observation version, consent and sensitive-field boundaries must survive every navigation. A stock launcher Activity alone cannot keep a side panel above every app. System-wide assistance needs the separate window/accessibility capability spike in the plan.

## Updating Eliza

1. Make generic changes in a dedicated `codex/` branch of the Eliza source and retain targeted tests.
2. Publish the commit so a clean clone can retrieve it. Prefer a reviewed upstream PR before release.
3. Update the submodule and `upstream.lock.json` together. The unused baseline copy is retired; retain its historical source provenance.
4. Run source-pin verification, product typecheck/tests/build, both APK flavors and emulator bridge/HOME tests. Upgrade one product at a time.
5. Before production, run upstream required root checks, the real auth/agent suite, signed-image build and physical-device acceptance. Reverting the submodule pin is the source rollback; installed APK/OS rollback must separately respect signing identity and Android versionCode rules.

No production secrets or signing keys belong in these repos. Account credentials are encrypted with Android Keystore AES-GCM in the app no-backup directory. Renderer preferences contain only nonsecret connection selection and conversation identifiers. Cloud voice requests bind to a specific saved credential generation. Platform backup remains disabled until retention/key ownership is specified.
