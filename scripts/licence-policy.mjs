/**
 * Licence policy (owner decision P-09, 2026-10-10): an open-source dependency licence never
 * stops a build and is never a release blocker. Every licence text and notice still ships, and
 * anything copyleft, unknown or unverified is FLAGGED, with what it obliges, in the notices
 * (JSON and text), in the build output (`LICENCE FLAG <flag>: <package>@<version> (<spdx>)`)
 * and in the machine-readable inventories (verify-apks `licenceFlags`, the SBOM).
 *
 * A flag is a statement of what was found. It is not legal review and not a clearance.
 *
 * One kind of item is outside that decision: a bundled proprietary font. It is not open-source
 * software, so it keeps one separately named check, `unresolved-font-licence`, which is always
 * run and recorded. The Denton typeface is recorded in licenses/font-licenses.json on the
 * owner's statement that the licence is held outside this repository; it is flagged
 * `proprietary-licence-held-outside-repo` and the check reports it resolved-by-owner-statement.
 * A font with no record at all is flagged `proprietary-no-licence-recorded` and reported
 * unresolved; whether an unresolved font withholds `distributable` is the single switch below.
