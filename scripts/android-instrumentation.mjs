 *
 * Variants share one package id and replace each other, so they run one after the
 * other: install app + test APK, check the installed bytes, run every class in its
 * own `am instrument` process, uninstall. Only packages this run installed are
 * removed; an existing Alpha installation is refused, never replaced.
 *
 * --home-role (launcher variant only) is the one phase that changes a device role: it records
 * the emulator's HOME holder, runs the classes that request the role themselves, selects the
 * launcher APK as HOME, cold-starts it with the HOME key, runs the classes that need Alpha to be
 * HOME, and always puts the original HOME back. If that cannot be proven the run fails, the
 * installed packages are left in place and the emulator must not be reused until it is recovered.
 *
 * Results: <output>/results.json via scripts/instrumentation-result.mjs, bound to
 * the source commit and every installed APK's SHA-256, with raw output per class.
 * This is emulator-class evidence (class E). It is not physical-device, AOSP image,
 * real-integration or user acceptance.
