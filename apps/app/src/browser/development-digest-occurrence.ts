 * `digestAdmission`), whose rules it mirrors:
 *  - a lapsed source is checked first and yields one explicit `unavailable` record that pauses the
 *    schedule until a new source is reviewed;
 *  - an occurrence more than 120 seconds late is recorded as `missed` and never run;
 *  - an occurrence is settled at most once.
 * Development schedules exist only with ELIZA_DEV_ALLOW_TEST_MOCKS.

 * missed, so a jump forward neither suppresses the real occurrences before it nor lets one pass
 * without a record. Only the most recent occurrence before `now` is ever considered, so a clock set
 * back onto an earlier day yields at most one truthful record for that day and never a backlog.
 *
 * Limits: an occurrence at or below `settledFloor` (older than the 32 remembered settlements, or
 * behind the newest record of a document written before the list existed) is treated as settled and
 * leaves no record; a civil time a zone skips (start of daylight saving) has no occurrence that day,
 * as on the agent, whose cron scan matches civil minutes.
